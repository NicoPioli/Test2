# Question 2

## The License Plate Problem

You work for the DMV; you have a specific, sequential way of generating new license plate numbers:
Each license plate number has 6 alphanumeric characters. The numbers always come before the letters.The first plate number is 000000, followed by 000001. Finally, when you arrive at 999999, the next entry would be 00000A, Followed by 00001A. When you arrive at 99999A, the next entry is 00000B. After following the pattern to 99999Z, the next in the sequence would be 0000AA.
When 9999AA is reached, the next in the series would be 0000AB...
The pattern overview looks a bit like the following:
000000
000001
...
999999
00000A
00001A
...
99999A
00000B
00001B
...
99999Z
0000AA
0001AA
...
9999AA
0000AB
0001AB
...
9999ZZ
000AAA
001AAA
...
ZZZZZZ
The goal is to write a function that takes some index n as a parameter and returns the nth element in this license plate sequence.

## Implementation Details

**Service Implementation:**  
The `LicensePlateService` handles the generation of license plates. It determines which group the provided index falls into by calculating the total number of plates per group. Within the correct group, it computes:

- **Numeric Part:** The numeric value is calculated using the remainder operation and is padded with leading zeros.
- **Letter Part:** The letter portion is generated by converting a quotient value to a base-26 string (mapping 0 → A, 1 → B, ..., 25 → Z) with a fixed length.

This logic ensures that the sequence follows the specified format and transitions correctly between groups.

## Why This Approach?

- **Efficiency:**  
  The solution uses simple arithmetic and base conversion methods, making it both efficient and scalable.

- **Clarity:**  
  Encapsulating the logic within the `LicensePlateService` ensures that the code is modular, easy to understand, and can be maintained or extended easily.

- **Angular Integration:**  
  By implementing the solution as an Angular service, it can be easily integrated into any Angular component and tested independently using Angular's testing tools.

## Testing Instructions

**Service Testing:**  
The test suite verifies that:

- The first license plate ("000000") is correctly generated for index 0.
- The service accurately transitions from numeric-only plates to alphanumeric plates (e.g., from "999999" to "00000A").
- Boundary conditions are correctly handled, such as the last plate in a group and the first plate of the next group.

**Component Integration Testing:**  
In addition to unit tests for the service, the functionality can be tested via the `LicensePlateComponent`. This component uses the `LicensePlateService` to generate a license plate based on a user-provided index. By entering an index and clicking the button in the component's interface, you can see the generated license plate displayed on the screen.

## Running the Tests

1. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Make sure all necessary packages are installed by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Tests:**
   ```bash
   ng test
   ```
